# zama-protocol
Programmable privacy with Fully Homomorphic Encryption applied to smart contracts.
🔐 Zama Protocol

Zama is building the future of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in Web3:
A new way to bring confidentiality and privacy-preserving smart contracts directly on-chain.

✨ What is Zama?

Zama is the team behind the FHEVM, the first EVM-compatible runtime that allows developers to:

🔒 Encrypt user data and still compute on it

📜 Write confidential smart contracts in Solidity

🌐 Deploy dApps that are private by default, without sacrificing decentralization

This means dApps can process sensitive information (finance, identity, health, gaming, AI) without ever exposing raw data.

🎯 Who is it for?

Builders → Develop next-gen privacy-preserving dApps with Solidity + FHE

Researchers → Explore applied cryptography in a live EVM environment

Communities → Access protocols where data confidentiality is guaranteed

🚀 Vision

Zama’s mission is simple:
Bring privacy to Web3 through the first real-world implementation of FHE at scale.
The goal: enable a new wave of applications where confidential computing is the norm, not the exception.
